# Autonomous Program Status

## Program
CrazyTrader.ai — Enterprise Local

## Mode
AUTONOMOUS PROGRAM

## Current phase
Phase 3 — Ledger/portfolio primitives

## Completed
- Phase 2 local market/data gate: PASS (63 unit/contract tests, 2 real market-store tests, actual public metadata/trade/depth reads)
- Phase 1 platform backbone gate: PASS (44 unit/contract tests; 8 real integration tests; actual container runtime smoke)
- Phase 0.5 foundation compatibility/license gate: PASS (live Nautilus submission deferred)
- Phase 0 repository/toolchain/contracts gate: PASS (43 tests)
- Architecture V1 baseline
- 2026-10-02 full conversation/repository audit and specification hardening

## Certification
L0 — DEVELOPMENT

## Working branch
`codex/enterprise-local-autonomous` — created and ready for the Codex Master Goal.

## Last durable commit
8de8c80231f91208529c82d29f49d7c1c76327fc — Phase 1 implementation published; hosted CI PASS.

## Next action
Execute docs/plans/2026-10-03-phase-3-ledger-portfolio.md: immutable per-asset balanced ledger contracts, additive PostgreSQL journal, idempotency/portfolio/reservation/concurrency tests. Phase 2 gate publication in progress; continue without phase-transition approval.

## Blockers
None for implementation. Future external actions: owner-local Claude authentication validation and Binance L5/L6 secrets/activation.

## Usage state
READY. Follow `docs/roadmap/CODEX_RESUME_PROTOCOL.md` if budget-limited.

## Latest verification
Phase 2 make check/integration PASS: 63 unit/contract tests, strict mypy (18 modules), 36 schema artifacts, source scan, offline SDK model/signature check; 8 PostgreSQL/NATS + API tests, 2 real PostgreSQL/ClickHouse/S3 tests. Actual bounded public SDK metadata/trade/depth normalization and wheel/sdist PASS. L0; REST fallback only, no continuous websocket/elapsed certification claim.
Phase 1 make check/integration PASS (44 unit tests; 8 dependency tests), non-root image and actual Compose migration/auth/worker restart smoke PASS. Phase 0.5 offline and seven local container candidate probes PASS; exact-tag licenses verified. Phase 0: 43 tests PASS; lint, formatting, strict mypy, 22 schema drift checks and source secret scan PASS; wheel/sdist build PASS. Hosted CI run 37068956651 PASS (make setup/check/integration).

## Durable-state rule
Update this file at every meaningful checkpoint, phase gate, blocker and usage-limit pause.
